# Bounding Box Assignment

This is a coding assignment for an interview from logiroad. The idea is to draw some bounding boxes on some given images given some parameters from the annotations.txt file. I used python and opencv to draw the rectangles on the images. The conda environment is included in the environment.yml file. 

# How to use

Please run the main.py file. To see all the next image, simply use a keyboard input.
