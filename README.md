# Bounding Box Assignment

This is a coding assignment for an interview from logiroad. The idea is to draw some bounding boxes on some given images given some parameters from the annotations.txt file. I used python and opencv to draw the rectangles on the images. The conda environment is included in the environment.yml file.
